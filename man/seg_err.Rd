\title{Piece-wise (two-segment) 1-norm regression error}
\usage{
seg_err(x, y, brk)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric vector of \eqn{x}-coordinates.}

\item{y}{Numeric vector of \eqn{y}-coordinates (same length as \code{x}).}

\item{brk}{Integer index designating the breakpoint (1 ≤ \code{brk} ≤ \code{length(x)}).}
}
\value{
Numeric scalar giving the total 1-norm error for that
breakpoint.
}
\description{
Computes the sum of absolute residuals obtained by fitting two
independent OLS lines to the portions of the curve lying to the left
and right of a proposed breakpoint.
}
\details{
The points \code{x[1:brk]} and \code{y[1:brk]} form the \emph{left} segment;
the points \code{x[brk:length(x)]} and \code{y[brk:length(x)]} form the
\emph{right} segment.  Each segment is fitted with an OLS line via
\code{.linerr()}, and the 1-norms (sum of absolute residuals) of the
two fits are added.
