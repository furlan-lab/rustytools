\title{Locate the “elbow” of a monotone curve}
\usage{
find_knee_pt(y, x = seq_along(y), make_plot = FALSE, y_axis = "Relative SSE")
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{Numeric vector of \eqn{y}-values (must have ≥ 3 points).}

\item{x}{Numeric vector of \eqn{x}-values (defaults to
\code{seq_along(y)}). Need not be sorted.}

\item{make_plot}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, a \pkg{ggplot2} graphic is
produced showing the curve and the detected knee.}
}
\value{
A list with components
\describe{
\item{knee_x}{The \eqn{x}-coordinate of the knee.}
\item{idx}{Integer index (1-based) of that knee in the supplied
vectors.}
\item{error_curve}{Numeric vector of summed absolute-error values
for every tested breakpoint (length = \code{length(y) - 2}).}
}
}
\description{
Implements a two–segment piece-wise linear method to identify the knee
(a.k.a. elbow) in a curve such as the reconstruction-error profile
obtained when varying the number of archetypes.
}
\examples{
ks  <- 2:25
err <- exp(-ks) + 0.05 * rnorm(length(ks))
knee_pt(err, ks, make_plot = TRUE)
