# Installing Rust

First you need to have an updated Rust installation. Go to this [site](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) to learn how to install Rust.


# Installing rustytools

You will need to have the devtools package installed...

```{r, eval=F}
devtools::install_github("furlan-lab/rustytools")
```

## Compilation errors with openblas

When building R packages that depend on BLAS/LAPACK functionality (e.g., via **openblas-src** or **RcppEigen**), you may encounter linker errors such as:

```
ld: -lto_library library filename must be 'libLTO.dylib'
OpenBLAS build failed: Subprocess returns with non-zero status: 2
```

or

```
 thread 'main' panicked at /private/var/folders/63/z3dzfmg53g31179qxhwt5cq00000gn/T/RtmpIhMjfg/R.INSTALL17d5e6ffc8bf0/rustytools/src/.cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-1949cf8c6b5b557f/openblas-src-0.10.11/build.rs:218:13:
  OpenBLAS build failed: Subprocess returns with non-zero status: 2
```

These errors typically arise because **openblas-src** is attempting to compile OpenBLAS from source using a GCC-fortran toolchain that injects a `-lto_library` flag incompatible with the Apple linker. However, the **openblas-src** crate in Rust or package builds in R defaults to building its own copy of OpenBLAS, invoking `gcc`/`gfortran` and ultimately passing `-lto_library` to `ld`.

Because Apple’s `ld` expects `-lto_library libLTO.dylib` (not `-lto_library /usr/local/...`), the link step fails.

Alternatively you may have non-standard installation sites of openblas, such as those on high-performance clusters.

At the moment, we have found only one foolproof method of compilation.


First, make sure you have [openblas](http://www.openmathlib.org/OpenBLAS/) installed on your system.
Second, clone rustytools in a shell in a directory you would like to install the source file i.e.:

```
cd yourdir/
git clone https://github.com/furlan-lab/rustytools.git

```

Then you have a few options

#### Easiest - declare system variable, then install repo

```
OPENBLAS_DIR=/your_openblas_dir

export OPENBLAS_DIR=/opt/homebrew/opt/openblas
# On Apple Silicon this is typically: /opt/homebrew/opt/openblas
# On Intel Macs this is typically: /usr/local/opt/openblas
# On an HPC this might be something like: /app/software/OpenBLAS/0.3.27-GCC-13.3.0
```

Then compile rustytools
```
R CMD install rustytools
```


#### User-level `.Renviron`

Create or edit `~/.Renviron` so that the variables are always available, even in non-interactive sessions (e.g., `R CMD INSTALL`, RStudio Build pane):

```bash
export OPENBLAS_DIR=/opt/homebrew/opt/openblas
# On Intel Macs:
export OPENBLAS_DIR=/usr/local/opt/openblas
```

> **Restart R or RStudio** after modifying `~/.Renviron`.

To verify in R:

```r
Sys.getenv("OPENBLAS_DIR")     # should print "/opt/homebrew/opt/openblas" or "/usr/local/opt/openblas"
```
### Project-level `.Renviron`

If you prefer to scope this configuration to a single package project, put a file named `.Renviron` in your package root:

```bash
# On Apple Silicon:
export OPENBLAS_DIR=/opt/homebrew/opt/openblas
# On Intel Macs:
export OPENBLAS_DIR=/usr/local/opt/openblas
```

### Providing openblas location specifically

**Use this approach for installing rustytools from devtools if you encounter openblas errors**

From within R

```{r, eval=F}
Sys.setenv("OPENBLAS_DIR"="/openblas_location")
Sys.setenv("OPENBLAS_DIR"="/usr/local/opt/openblas")
# On Apple Silicon this is typically: opt/homebrew/opt/openblas
# On Intel Macs this is typically: /usr/local/opt/openblas
# On an HPC this might be something like: /app/software/OpenBLAS/0.3.27-GCC-13.3.0
Sys.setenv(
  OPENBLAS_VENDOR = "system",
  OPENBLAS_DIR    = "/usr/local/opt/openblas"
)
devtools::install_github("furlan-lab/rustytools")

withr::with_envvar(c(OPENBLAS_DIR    = "/usr/local/opt/openblas"),
  devtools::install_github("furlan-lab/rustytools")
)
```


# Overview of Sequence Alignment

This vignette introduces the `align()` function from the `rustytools` package, which provides a Rust-backed, high-performance implementation of the Smith-Waterman algorithm. This algorithm supports global, local, semiglobal, and fully custom alignment modes using affine gap penalties.

The underlying engine is a generalized variant of the Smith-Waterman algorithm provided by the `bio-edit` crate, which offers:

* Match/mismatch scoring via custom or predefined functions
* Affine gap penalties (gap open + gap extension)
* Flexible boundary behavior via customizable clipping penalties

# Alignment Modes

`rustytools` supports three classic modes and a flexible custom mode:

* **Global alignment**: No clipping is allowed; aligns full length of both sequences.
* **Local alignment**: Finds the highest-scoring subsequences.
* **Semiglobal alignment**: Global on one sequence, local on the other (e.g., full query to partial reference).
* **Custom alignment**: Full control over boundary conditions via clip penalties.

# Example: Semiglobal Alignment

Here is an example aligning a query sequence to a longer reference:

```{r}
library(rustytools)

query <- "ACCGTGGAT"
reference <- "AAAAACCGTTGAT"

# Perform semiglobal alignment
score <- align(query, reference, atype = "semi-global", verbose = F)
score
```

This returns an alignment score that considers:

* Matches = +1
* Mismatches = -1
* Gap open = -5
* Gap extend = -1
* No penalty for clipping the start/end of the reference

# Custom Alignment Configuration

Custom alignments allow full specification of prefix/suffix penalties. Example:

```{r,eval = F}
score <- align(
  query,
  reference,
  atype = "custom",
  match_score = 1,
  mismatch_score = -3,
  gap_open = -5,
  gap_extend = -1,
  xclip_prefix = -10, # allow prefix skips in query
  xclip_suffix = -9999, # require alignment to end
  yclip_prefix = 0,     # allow local match to ref
  yclip_suffix = 0
)
score
```

This setting mimics semiglobal alignment where the query can skip leading bases but must align to the end.

# Use Cases in Genomics

Common applications include:

* Mapping short variable sequences (e.g. CDR3s) to consensus references
* Comparing VDJ segments to known clone sequences
* Imputing mutations into reference haplotypes

See the [sequence alignment vignette](articles/seqAlign.html) for an example using single cell RNA seq data in B cell leukemia

# Summary

The alignment engine in `rustytools` is highly flexible and efficient. It is particularly well-suited to bioinformatics tasks involving fuzzy or partial sequence matching. For large datasets or many pairwise alignments, this Rust backend provides a dramatic speed advantage over traditional R-native solutions.


# Other Tools

`rustytools` includes additional fast backends for:

* **FASTA reading** – random access to large genome files
  See the [Fasta vignette](getConsensus.html)
* **MAGIC** – imputation of scRNA-seq using diffusion maps
  See the [MAGIC vignette](magic.html)
* **PCHA** – archetypal decomposition of matrices
  See the [PCHA vignette](pcha.html)

Each tool is designed for high performance, especially on large-scale single-cell or genome-wide data.
