# Overview

This vignette demonstrates how to extract contiguous consensus sequence blocks from a FASTA file using `rustytools`, and how to annotate them with genomic features from various sources such as UCSC, GENCODE, and Ensembl.

This is particularly useful for processing FASTA files derived from consensus calling pipelines (e.g., `samtools consensus`) and for downstream variant or feature annotation.

```{r, eval=F}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("furlan-lab/rustytools", force = TRUE)
```

# Load Required Packages

```{r, message=FALSE}
rm(list = ls())
suppressPackageStartupMessages({
  library(rustytools)
  library(GenomicRanges)
})
```

# Extracting Consensus Sequences

The `get_consensus()` function extracts sequence blocks containing A/C/T/G from a FASTA file and returns a `GRanges` object with embedded sequence metadata.

```{r}
root <- file.path(.libPaths()[1], "rustytools/extdata")
tfasta <- file.path(root, "test.fa")
results <- get_consensus(tfasta, cores = 1, genome = "toy")
results[[1]]
```

The `cores` parameter defines how many threads to use (typically one per chromosome). For toy examples, multi-core use is unnecessary.

# Running on Large FASTA Files

For real genomes, such as those from HLA typing or clinical samples:

```{r, eval=F}
fasta <- "~/Desktop/Junk/GENDX_HLA_Mix1_S1_L001_t1000.fa"
#results <- get_consensus(fasta, cores = 16, genome = "hg38")
```

To test on only the **first few contigs** before running a full genome:

```{r, eval=F}
results <- get_consensus(fasta, cores = 16, genome = "hg38", test_with_n = 1)
```

---

# Reducing and Merging Consensus Ranges

You can merge nearby regions using `reduce()`:

```{r, eval=F}
reduced_results <- reduce(results[[1]], min.gapwidth = 2L)
```

# Annotation Methods

## 1. UCSC KnownGene (TxDb)

```{r, eval=F}
library(TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38.knownGene)
library(VariantAnnotation)

txdb_hg38 <- TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38.knownGene
si <- seqinfo(txdb_hg38)

# Ensure correct seqinfo
reduced_results@seqinfo <- GenomeInfoDb::Seqinfo(
  seqnames = si@seqnames[1:22],
  seqlengths = si@seqlengths[1:22],
  isCircular = rep(NA, 22),
  genome = "hg38"
)

annotated_results <- locateVariants(reduced_results, txdb_hg38, AllVariants())
table(annotated_results$LOCATION)
annotated_results[annotated_results$LOCATION == "coding"]
```

## 2. GENCODE GTF Annotation with `txdbmaker`

```{r, eval=F}
library(txdbmaker)

gtf_file <- "/Users/sfurlan/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-SharedLibraries-FredHutchinsonCancerCenter/Furlan_Lab - General/resources/refs/gencode.v46.annotation.gtf.gz"

txdb <- makeTxDbFromGFF(gtf_file, format = "gtf", dbxrefTag = "gene_name")
annotated_results2 <- locateVariants(reduced_results, txdb, AllVariants())
head(annotated_results2)
```

## 3. Ensembl-based Annotation with `ChIPpeakAnno`

```{r, eval=F}
library(ChIPpeakAnno)
library(ensembldb)
library(EnsDb.Hsapiens.v86)

annoGR <- toGRanges(EnsDb.Hsapiens.v86)
seqlevelsStyle(reduced_results) <- seqlevelsStyle(annoGR)

annotated_results3 <- annoPeaks(reduced_results, annoGR, bindingType = "fullRange")
annotated_results3[grepl("^HLA", annotated_results3$gene_name)]$gene_name
```

---

# Summary

* `get_consensus()` extracts contiguous sequence blocks from FASTA files.
* Results are returned as `GRanges` objects that are easily annotated.
* Annotations can be performed using UCSC TxDb, GENCODE GTFs, or Ensembl databases.

This workflow is ideal for consensus-based variant discovery, isoform localization, or follow-up annotation after long-read assemblies.
